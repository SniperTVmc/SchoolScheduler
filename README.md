# School Scheduler
### ~~----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

### Hello there! üëã<br>
&emsp;Welcome on my school timetable generator project!<br>
<br>
&emsp;Ever since I was a kid, I always thought that programs were used to create the different schedules, and the different classes.<br>
&emsp;But not really, it turns out that it was actually the supervisors or administrative staff who were in charge. (Of course, one by one, manually)<br>
&emsp;That's why I asked myself, why not create this program?
&emsp;Well, that's what I've got in mind, even though I'm well aware that I'm going to run into a lot of difficulties, mainly with the algorithm, which is likely to be very impressive.<br>
&emsp;But I don't want to give up hope, and want to make it possible. üí™<br>
<br>
&emsp;What's more, I want to set up a bunch of options, allowing the schedules to be adapted to each school.<br>
&emsp;For the time being, I'm basing my project on the French school system, but if it is successful, I'll continue it on a European scale first, then on a worldwide scale.<br>
